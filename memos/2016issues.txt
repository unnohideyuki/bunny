Issue#2016Nov001: Missing default assumption of main :: IO ()

testcases/test8c.hs fails with "cannot resolve ambiguity."

- Added to tnitial Assump, Main::IO t0, however, does not work, why?
- When an explicit type signature, Main::IO (), specified,
  it should be type checked and override the initial assumption.

Issue#2016Nov002: (todo) the order of concatenation of Assumps.

(as1 ++ as2) and (as2 ++ as1) are different.
Did I write this correctly every times?

Issue#2016Nov003: Type classes having two or more super-class

for example, Ord => Char dictionary shoud have a way to invoke (==) method of Eq.
